# Car-Price-Prediction
* Car Price Prediction It is the Prediction Model based On Regression Algorithm of Machine Learning. The research objective of this study is to predict used cars prices in India using Machine learning techniques. To enable consumers to know the actual worth of their car or desired car, by simply providing the program with a set of attributes from the desired car to predict the car price. The purpose of this study is to understand and evaluate used car prices in the India, and to develop a strategy that utilizes Machine Learning techniques to predict used car prices.
